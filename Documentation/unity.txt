Useful information regarding unity and C#:

- When to attach a script to a gameObject?
    1. When the script interacts with a gameObject in the scene or when the script uses Unity methods
    that interacts with a gameObject in the scene e.g "StartCoroutine".

- When to make a class static?
    1. When we are not going to make objects with that class. Only call methods, retrieve data...

- How to call a script from another script?
    1. If the script is attached to a gameobject -> this.GetComponent<ClassWeWantToCall>();
    2. If the script is not attached to a gameobject -> Make the class we want to call public. Now we can access its fields. 
        If the class is static we can access them directly through the class, otherwise we need to call them on an instance.
